# Attendance App

## About
Taking and maintaining attendance in pen and paper is quite a hectic task for teachers. So I put this same concept on the mobile application so that a teacher can take and maintain attendance inside the mobile application. And also they can export the attendance data as a ‘.xls’ file at any time.
